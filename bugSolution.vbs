Improved Error Handling and Type Checking:

To avoid runtime type errors, always explicitly declare variable types using the `Dim` statement and specify the type (e.g., `Dim myVar As Integer`).  Validate user inputs and data from external sources to ensure they conform to expected types before using them in calculations or other operations.

Refined `On Error Resume Next` Usage:

Use `On Error Resume Next` sparingly and only for specific, well-defined scenarios. Always include error handling mechanisms to properly log and recover from predictable errors. Avoid using it to broadly suppress all errors.  For example, instead of swallowing exceptions, use structured exception handling with `On Error GoTo` and specific error handling routines.

Memory Management in Larger Scripts:

In larger scripts, explicitly release object references when they are no longer needed using `Set object = Nothing`.  Avoid creating large arrays or collections unnecessarily. Break down tasks into smaller, more manageable functions.

Example of Improved Code:
```vbscript
Dim myVar As Integer
myVar = 10
result = myVar + 5
```

```vbscript
On Error GoTo ErrHandler
' ... your code...
Exit Sub
ErrHandler:
  MsgBox "Error: " & Err.Number & " - " & Err.Description
  ' ... error handling logic ...
End Sub
```
